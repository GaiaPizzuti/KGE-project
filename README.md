# Introduction
This repository contains the project created for the course "Knowledge Graph Engineering" at the University of Trento during the academic year 2024/2025, the title of the project is "International Digital University".
The project aims to create a knowledge graph that represents the collaborations between universities, in terms of projects, publications and staff. In order to achieve this goal the iTelos methodology has been used, which is a methodology divided in different phases whose result is the final knowledge graph.

# Phase 1
In the first phase different aspects of the project are defined:
- Informal Purpose
- Domain of Interest
- Scenarios
- Personas
- Competency Questions
- ER model

Some examples will be provided in the following subsections, a more comprehensive explanation of each element can be found in the PDF report.
## Personas 
The personas are the people who will use the knowledge graph, some examples are:
| Name | Age  | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dr. Maria Rossi | 28 | Researcher at University of Trento|
| Prof. Bat Erdene | 41 | Senior Lecturer at National University of Mongolia|
## Competency Questions

Competency questions are used to define how the different personas will use the knowledge graph, some examples are:

| Personas                | Field                  | Question                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maria Rossi, Bat Erdene | Research Collaboration | Who are the researchers from both universities that have worked together on a  specific project or paper? |
| Bat Erdene              | Researcher Information | Which students are pursuing a PhD in Computer Science?       |
